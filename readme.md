<h1>Laravel Multiple Roles Authentication and Authorization</h1>
<p>This application is all about Roles with authorization, Where a each role can access, their own data, if something comes in common we can manage by using only or other conditions in constructor, or something like dependency injection. So coming to this project, Here i have create three roles like 
    <ul>
        <li>Admin</li>
        <li>Teacher</li>
        <li>Student</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Where admin can view all the registered users, Teacher can view only Students and in terms of student he can view only teacher. So, this project demo is just to show how a middleware is created and maintained with routes grouped based on middleware.</p>
<p>If any question you are sure to ask me.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Here you can just clone this application and use it where its very easy to customize.</p>
